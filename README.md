# Modeling-of-fluctuations
Repository for our team's project

Task is to create a visualisation of fluctuations, basing on the start-up conditions.

Input consists of several variables: 
1) x0 - initial length of spring without deformation
2) k - asperity of spring
3) A - amplitude of motor fluctuations
4) alpha0 - the start-up angle
5) v0 - initial speed of body along the rod
6) w0 - initial angular speed of body
7) mu/m - ratio coefficient of friction to mass
8) A4 - coefficient at t^4
9) B - coefficient at t^3
10) C - coefficient at t^2
11) D - coefficient at t
12) E - free member
fi is function of time. fi specifies phase change of motor. fi is polynomial of degree 4. fi = A_4t^4 + Bt^3 + Ct^2 + Dt + E 
Spring is unloaded in t = 0.
